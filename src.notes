creating the applesoft translator requires:
ORCA/C (used ONLY to facilitate data creation)
ORCA/M
REZ

It should be VERY trivial to convert this into an Integer Basic importer.
Importing GSoft Basic files is slightly more complex, but not much.  See
the GSoft book Appendices.

the "install" script will compile & install translator.
